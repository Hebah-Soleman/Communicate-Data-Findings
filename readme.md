## Project Details

This project is the last  project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
The project is highlights visualization part in during data analysis.
The analysis begins with exploring single variables then bivariate and multivariate variables.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the information of 900 passengers who were on board the Titanic,
including the information of whose survived.

## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the data, we found that the most survivors were from passengers in first class, 
and this is normal because they are the focus of attention.
Also, women had a greater chance of survival than men. Indeed, 
the number of survivors was more women than men, because the number of men is more than the number of women.
The most survivor ages were between 20 to 40 year, base on that maybe the age is the main factor that affected the survival chance.
Other details display in presentation slides.

## Key Insights for Presentation

In the presentation I chose plots which help to clear present the effect of many variables on survivors, 
to make it easier for the reader to connect between written facts and plots easily.
